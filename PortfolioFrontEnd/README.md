Front End project

-- Purpose : 
This project should show different projects as a portfolio but also, as a good way to keep track  of
interesting projects

-- Current projects:
-> Maze: Show cases use of web assembly to quickly generate Mazes with different biases in the horizontal
and vertical orientations. 
TODO: 
- Add the Maze solver to the website -- this is already written on the back end but needs to be 
compiled and the js glue needs to be coded.
- Using the same method to generate the Maze solution other Maze methods could also be done.
- Additionally, alternative and faster methods for solving mazes could be written. 

-> Flag Sudoku:
- grid and flag generation has been written.
- data set and script to use data set has been generated.
- Interaction and selection of Maze has also been set up.
TODO:
- Analyse the data set in c and come up with a set of viable Sudoku boards and their solutions
- Add some information about the Sudoku board, its difficulty, etc.

-> Quantum memory:
Memory board where each of the pieces state is decided upon observation. 
Add a discussion about the EPR paradox. 
TODO:
- Add a conceptualization for how entanglement would work in this memory board
